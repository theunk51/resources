# Resources For programming

You should keep in mind that there is no universal way to learn code -- everyone learns differently. You might have to do some expiriementing to find what approach works best for you because what works for me might not work for you.


## Docs
[Python Documentation](http://docs.python.org/3/)


## Websites
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Has tutorials/references for the most popular/common programming languages. If you do use w3schools for Python, start from the beginning because there are some things Project Stem hasn't taught.
- [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - 6 chapters of the "basics" of python and 12 chapters of practical projects, each chapter being a different project
- [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org) - Mostly for web development (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.).
- [The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python!](https://python-guide.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) - practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python
- [Real Python](https://realpython.org) - Has lots of tutorials ranging from Python sytanx to advanced projects. The site is freemium so some of the courses are locked to unsuscribed users.
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/) - Similar to W3School, has brief but insightful tutorials for some of the most common languages. Programiz is better suited as a quick reference, though their [DSA](https://www.programiz.com/dsa) tuturials are great as a stand alone


## Books
I was going to put a rec list here when I found reddit had a better one. This [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/books) comes the r/learnpython wiki and is a better list than what I could have up with.
